# Grand Theft Auto San Andreas V4.00
Just a compilation of fixes and improvements for the Playstation 2 version

Since tools were created to modify the Playstation 2 version, I have been trying to fix and improve the PS2 version. In addition to my own fixes that I created for this version, the vast majority of improvements come from mods created by the community, mainly because of MixMods and its maintainer Djjr. Many changes were made over the years, I myself no longer remember all of them, but I will list the ones I remember now:


- The game script: My original intention was to use v2.01 (aka V3.00) as it has optimized variables, but unfortunately this requires modifying the executable. So I modified v1.03 to fix two missions (4000 to 2500 points in the car dance mission, and the plane fuel)
- SNPatch by Daniel Santos (editing fileload.nm in the hexadecimal editor removing the name GTA3_1.img) but I also removed GTA_INT_1.
- Several files that rockstar never corrected in the PS2 version
- Corrected vehicles, with the correct reflection texture, chrome, glass, lighting...
- Texture improvement: Generic effects and textures were based on my own mods, and were converted to the PS2, optimizing efficiency to the maximum due to memory and color palette limitations
- A huge amount of textures were manually edited by me, and the pal_4 and pal_8 color palette was optimized.
- All of the game's TXD files were rebuilt and optimized, resulting in a smaller final size and faster loading, even improving the loading speed when the game runs via USB on the OPL.
- The game's memory stream has been carefully edited to slightly improve pop in, and slightly increase space for some fixed textures
- This version has the mod loader from Daniel Santos
